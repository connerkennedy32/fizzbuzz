# Fizzbuzz

Discover what numbers are multiples of 5 and/or 3 with this easy fizzbuzz application.

Simply input an integer and the program will then print all the integers leading up to it starting from 0. If an integer within that range is a multiple of 3 the program will print **Fizz**. If the integer is a mulitple of 5 the program will print **Buzz**. If the integer is both a multiple of 3 and 5 the program will print **Fizzbuzz**.
 
## Requirements
